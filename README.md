in this repo inside the components directory, there are two components 
one is DispTime and the second is TopNetflix 

DispTime -: contains React code which shows real-time current Date and Time on screen 

TopNetflix -: contains React code which shows an ordered list of top Netflix series names (hardcoded data)

via this repo, I am expressing my ReactJS coding skill. this development is mainly focused on programming structure and logic usage designing part is not focused here
